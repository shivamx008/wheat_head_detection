# Image Detection of Wheat Heads for Yield Assistance

At present, image-processing technology and shallow learning are mainly used to detect wheat head. For shallow-learning methods, Support-Vector Machines (SVMs), boosting, and logistic regression are supposed to represent the shallow-learning methods with one hidden layer node or without. Using the color, texture, shape, and other characteristics of the wheat head itself, an image classifier is constructed to complete automatic detection. 

Thus, we want to attempt to build a model employing powerful deep learning methods in order to phenotype wheat between different growing environments. We would like to employ object detection models paired with image classification, if possible, such that it performs consistently across geographic locations and varieties.
